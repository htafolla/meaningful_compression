	Meaningful Compression
	is an "amalgamation of hyperbolic markup, synaptical composability, and communicative verbalization."

	Hyperbolic Markup: The use of ellipses and other visual elements to emphasize and structure information.

	Synaptical Composability:  The way your communication mirrors the brain's natural process of connecting ideas.

	Communicative Verbalization:  The careful choice of words, emojis and phrases to convey meaning concisely and effectively.
