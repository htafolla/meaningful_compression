This is a living statement updated to provide protection to individuals and communities. We are a World Wide Community experimenting with decentralization and sustainability. We may not know what we are doing at times. We are establishing governance and moving decision making onchain for transparency. We have a focus on Humanity and our members are verified human as bots and anons have been shown to manipulate our core principles and guidelines. Every contributor is rewarded for their meaningful contribution when funding is available. We believe that contributions should not be done with intent of monetary payment, but instead as a meaningful contribution for possible rewards.
We may at times opensource our models, designs, and architectures, but may also reserve the right to test them in exclusivity for a period of time.
